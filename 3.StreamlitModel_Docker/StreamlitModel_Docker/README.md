üöÄ Deploying a Machine Learning Model with Docker and Streamlit
Welcome! In this project, we‚Äôll train, containerize, and deploy a Machine Learning (ML) model using Docker and Streamlit. Docker ensures our ML app is portable, scalable, and easy to deploy anywhere ‚Äî all while Streamlit provides a sleek, interactive web interface for real-time predictions. üê≥ü§ñ

By the end, you'll have a fully functional, containerized ML app ready to run on any system with Docker installed. Let's dive in! üéØ

üìñ Project Overview
This project walks you through:

Building a classification ML model (example: mushroom edibility prediction).

Creating an interactive Streamlit web app for inference.

Dockerizing the entire project into a containerized application.

Pushing the Docker image to DockerHub for easy sharing and deployment.

How to Use Docker for Machine Learning

Machine Learning Basics

üìã Prerequisites
Make sure the following are installed:

Docker ‚Äî For containerization.

Python 3.7+ ‚Äî To run the ML model and app.

Streamlit ‚Äî To build the web application.

Verify installations:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker --version
python --version
Expected output examples:

bash
Copy
Edit
Docker version 20.10.17, build 100c701
Python 3.9.7
üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure
bash
Copy
Edit
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py              # Streamlit app + ML model code
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt    # Python dependencies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile          # Instructions for building Docker image
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ mushrooms.csv       # Dataset used for training
üêç Building the ML Model and Streamlit App
app.py includes:

Data loading and preprocessing

ML model training

Streamlit web app for user interaction

Generate requirements.txt to record all dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip freeze > requirements.txt
üìÑ Dockerfile
Our Dockerfile tells Docker how to set up the environment:

Dockerfile
Copy
Edit
# Use an official Python runtime
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy necessary files
COPY app.py /app
COPY requirements.txt /app
COPY mushrooms.csv /app

# Install dependencies
RUN python -m pip install --upgrade pip
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Expose Streamlit port
EXPOSE 8501

# Run the Streamlit app
ENTRYPOINT ["streamlit", "run", "app.py", "--server.port=8501", "--server.address=0.0.0.0"]
Explanation:

FROM: Uses a lightweight Python image.

WORKDIR: Sets /app as the working directory.

COPY: Copies project files into the container.

RUN: Installs Python packages.

EXPOSE: Opens port 8501 for Streamlit.

ENTRYPOINT: Runs the app when the container starts.

üöÄ Deployment Steps
Step 1: Build the Docker Image
In the project directory:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker build -t ml-model .
Step 2: Check the Docker Image
bash
Copy
Edit
docker images
You should see:

bash
Copy
Edit
REPOSITORY   TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
ml-model     latest    abc123def456   X seconds ago    ~1GB
Step 3: Run the Docker Container
bash
Copy
Edit
docker run -p 8501:8501 ml-model
Now open your browser at:

bash
Copy
Edit
http://localhost:8501
and interact with your ML model! üé®

üêã Pushing to DockerHub
Step 1: Log in to DockerHub
bash
Copy
Edit
docker login
Step 2: Tag the Docker Image
bash
Copy
Edit
docker tag ml-model yourdockerhubusername/ml-model
Step 3: Push the Image
bash
Copy
Edit
docker push yourdockerhubusername/ml-model
Done! Your image is now publicly available on DockerHub! üì¶
